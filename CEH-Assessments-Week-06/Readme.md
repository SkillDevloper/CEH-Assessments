# 🔐 CEH v13 – Week 06: Vulnerability Assessment using Nessus & Acunetix

In Week 06 of my CEH v13 learning journey, I explored **vulnerability assessment** using two industry-standard tools: **Tenable Nessus** and **Acunetix Web Vulnerability Scanner**.

This exercise focused on identifying, analyzing, and reporting security vulnerabilities in both system-level and web application environments.
