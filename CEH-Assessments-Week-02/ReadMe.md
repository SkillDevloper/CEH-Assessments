# Week 2 ‚Äì OSINT & IoT Device Discovery

## üìò Part 1: Conceptual

### Q1: Define following terminologies:

- **Confidentiality**: Ensuring that data is accessible only to authorized individuals and protected from unauthorized access.
- **Integrity**: Maintaining the accuracy and reliability of data by preventing unauthorized modifications or corruption.
- **Authentication**: The process of verifying the identity of users, devices, or systems before granting access.

### Q2: CEH Methodology Flow Diagram Explanation

This diagram represents the System Hacking Process in ethical hacking. It includes:

1. **Footprinting** ‚Äì Gathering publicly available information
2. **Scanning** ‚Äì Identifying vulnerabilities and open ports
3. **Enumeration** ‚Äì Extracting system details (usernames, shares)
4. **Vulnerability Analysis** ‚Äì Analyzing for possible exploitation

Then starts the system hacking process:

- **Gaining Access** ‚Äì Exploit vulnerabilities
- **Privilege Escalation** ‚Äì Gain root/admin rights
- **Maintaining Access** ‚Äì Install backdoors
- **Clearing Logs** ‚Äì Remove evidence

### üìå Conclusion

- Tesla‚Äôs public digital footprint is secure but reveals a lot of tech stack & infrastructure data.
- Several IoT devices around the world are publicly accessible ‚Äî webcams, printers, and smart home devices.
- OSINT + Shodan can reveal critical exposure which may be used in cyberattacks if not protected.
